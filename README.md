## Installation

Laser Eyes can be installed using popular package managers. Choose the one that fits your development environment:

### Using Yarn

```bash
yarn add @omnisat/lasereyes
```

### Using npm

```bash
npm install @omnisat/lasereyes
```

### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add @omnisat/lasereyes
```

### Using Bun

```bash
bun add @omnisat/lasereyes
```

## Quick Start

1. **Wrap your app with `LaserEyesProvider`:**

   To initialize Laser Eyes in your application, wrap your components with `LaserEyesProvider`. Make sure to configure the correct network (mainnet or testnet).

   ```javascript
   import { LaserEyesProvider, TESTNET } from "@omnisat/lasereyes";
   
   function App() {
     return (
       <LaserEyesProvider config={{ network: TESTNET }}>
         {/* Your app components */}
         <WalletConnector />
       </LaserEyesProvider>
     );
   }
   ```

   **Note:** Do not render `LaserEyesProvider` during Server-Side Rendering (SSR). Ensure it is conditionally rendered on the client-side to prevent conflicts.

2. **Use the `useLaserEyes` hook to interact with wallets:**

   The `useLaserEyes` hook gives you access to wallet functions such as connecting to a wallet, sending Bitcoin, and signing messages.

   ```javascript
   import { useLaserEyes, UNISAT } from "@omnisat/lasereyes";

   function WalletConnector() {
     const {
       connect,
       connected,
       address,
       balance,
       sign,
       sendBTC,
       switchNetwork,
     } = useLaserEyes();

     const handleConnect = () => {
       connect(UNISAT);
     };

     return (
       <div>
         {!connected ? (
           <button onClick={handleConnect}>Connect Wallet</button>
         ) : (
           <div>
             <p>Connected Address: {address}</p>
             <p>Balance: {balance.total}</p>
           </div>
         )}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

## Key Features

- **Multi-Wallet Support:** Seamless integration with Bitcoin wallets like OYL, Unisat, Xverse, and Leather.
- **React Integration:** Context setup with `LaserEyesProvider` and wallet functions with `useLaserEyes`.
- **Comprehensive Wallet Operations:** Balance checking, transaction signing, and message signing are fully supported.
- **TypeScript Support:** Strong typing for improved productivity and code reliability.
- **Network Switching:** Easily switch between mainnet and testnet.
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error handling across different wallet implementations.

## Common Use Cases

### Connecting Wallets

Use the `connect()` method to connect to a wallet. Make sure to check for wallet availability before attempting a connection.

```javascript
const { connect, connected, hasUnisat } = useLaserEyes();

if (hasUnisat && !connected) {
  await connect(UNISAT);
}
```

### Sending Bitcoin

Send Bitcoin to a specific address using the `sendBTC()` method. Ensure you have sufficient funds in the wallet.

```javascript
const recipient = "bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq";
const amount = 1000; // in satoshis

try {
  const txId = await sendBTC(recipient, amount);
  console.log("Transaction ID:", txId);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error sending BTC:", error);
}
```

### Signing Messages

Sign messages securely using the `sign()` method. This can be useful for proving ownership of a wallet address without revealing the private key.

```javascript
const message = "Hello, Bitcoin!";

try {
  const signature = await sign(message);
  console.log("Message signed. Signature:", signature);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error signing message:", error);
}
```

### Handling PSBTs

You can sign and push Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) using the `signPsbt()` and `pushPsbt()` methods.

```javascript
const psbtHex = "70736274ff01..."; // Your PSBT hex string

try {
  const { signedPsbtHex, txId } = await signPsbt(psbtHex, true);
  const txId = await pushPsbt(signedPsbtHex);
  console.log("Transaction ID:", txId);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error handling PSBT:", error);
}
```

### Switching Networks

Switch between Bitcoin networks using the `switchNetwork()` method.

```javascript
try {
  await switchNetwork("testnet");
  console.log("Switched to testnet");
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error switching network:", error);
}
```

### Error Handling

All wallet-related operations should be wrapped in `try-catch` blocks to handle errors gracefully.

```javascript
try {
  await connect(UNISAT);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to connect:", error);
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration

Create a custom configuration using `createConfig()`.

```javascript
import { createConfig } from "@omnisat/lasereyes";

const config = createConfig({
  network: "testnet",
  provider: "unisat",
  chainId: 1,
});
```

### Best Practices

- **Check Wallet Connection:** Always verify if the wallet is connected before performing operations.
- **Handle Network Changes:** Update address, balance, and other network-specific data when switching networks.
- **Provide Feedback:** Keep users informed during wallet operations, especially when user interaction is required.
- **Validate User Input:** Always validate addresses and amounts before sending transactions.

## Potential Issues

1. **Wallet Not Installed:** Ensure that the wallet (e.g., Unisat or XVerse`) is installed before attempting to connect.
2. **Network Mismatch:** Switching networks may cause discrepancies in balance and address data. Handle these changes properly.
3. **Transaction Delays:** Bitcoin transactions can take time to confirm on the network, so provide users with updates.
